# The Role of Tacit Knowledge in Innovation: A Review of the Recent Literature

This paper investigates the role of tacit knowledge in innovation through a review of the literature from 2015 onwards, integrating citation and co-author network analysis with generative AI. Tacit knowledge, characterised by its context-specific, intuitive, and experiential nature, enables organisations to address complex problems that explicit knowledge cannot resolve. A synthesis of 26 definitions from 50 influential articles underscores tacit knowledge's cognitive and experiential dimensions, with leadership and social capital emerging as critical facilitators of knowledge sharing. Although digital platforms support structured knowledge flows, they often fail to convey tacit knowledge's subtle, intuitive aspects, especially in remote work settings. The review also highlights the impact of cultural and industry-specific factors on tacit knowledge sharing and identifies gaps related to group-level tacit knowledge and ideation. Future research should explore how cognitive traits such as intuition and divergent thinking contribute to tacit knowledge sharing and innovation, particularly in remote work contexts.
